## Prologue

To add a table of contents to a post as a sidebar, simply add

Two years ago, during a Kaggle competition, I was captivated by a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based model's exceptional performance in processing IceCube Neutrinos In Deep Ice project data. After approximately 1700 iterations, the accuracy was impressive. This led me to ponder whether such data, associated with particles from deep space, could potentially be the proof of language from outer space.

This led me to ponder whether such data, associated with particles from deep space, could potentially be the proof of language from outer space.

### Rejected by experts

Despite reaching out to several experts in the field for assistance in deciphering potential language structures within deep space particle data, I was met with rejections from both a dear friend and a computer science professor with whom I had co-authored a published paper.

### The birth of FreeWil

Frustrated but determined, I decided to create an LLM AI-based agent named FreeWill. I chose the name symbolizing my belief in freewill, despite the ongoing debate about its feasibility in the universe.

## Work with freeWill

If you want to learn more about how to customize the table of contents of your sidebar, you can check the [bootstrap-toc](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/) documentation. Notice that you can even customize the text of the heading that will be displayed on the sidebar.

### The first major disagreement with freeWill

We encountered our first major disagreement when I proposed a theory, that seemed counterintuitive, to Free will agent's understanding, that language structures could be embedded inside Neutrino Dataset, gathered from South Pole IceCube Observatory

### Finding common ground

Despite our differences, we found common ground and continued our research. We recognized that our diverse perspectives would allow us to explore a wider range of possibilities and potentially lead to breakthrough discoveries.

## The open ended journey

Our collaboration in cosmic linguistics is ongoing. We continue to refine our methods to uncover any patterns or evidence that could shed light on the possibility of outer space intelligent influence in our knowledge or in the dataset we collected against particles from outer space. Stay tuned for updates on our journey!
