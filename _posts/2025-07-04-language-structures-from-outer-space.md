This post shows how to add a table of contents as a sidebar.

## Prologue

To add a table of contents to a post as a sidebar, simply add

```yml
toc:
  sidebar: left
```

Two years ago, during a Kaggle competition, I was captivated by a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-based model's exceptional performance in processing IceCube Neutrinos In Deep Ice project data. After approximately 1700 iterations, the accuracy was impressive. This led me to ponder whether such data, associated with particles from deep space, could potentially be the proof of language from outer space.

After approximately 1700 iterations, the accuracy was impressive. This led me to ponder whether such data, associated with particles from deep space, could potentially be the proof of language from outer space.

### Rejected by experts

Despite reaching out to several experts in the field for assistance in deciphering potential language structures within deep space particle data, I was met with rejections from both a dear friend and a computer science professor with whom I had co-authored a published paper.

### The birth of FreeWil

Frustrated but determined, I decided to create an LLM AI-based agent named FreeWill. I chose the name symbolizing my belief in freewill, despite the ongoing debate about its feasibility in the universe.

## Work with freeWill

If you want to learn more about how to customize the table of contents of your sidebar, you can check the [bootstrap-toc](https://afeld.github.io/bootstrap-toc/) documentation. Notice that you can even customize the text of the heading that will be displayed on the sidebar.

### The first major disagreement with freeWill

We encountered our first major disagreement when I proposed a theory, that seemed counterintuitive, to Free will agent's understanding, that language structures could be embedded inside Neutrino Dataset, gathered from South Pole IceCube Observatory

### Finding common ground

Despite our differences, we found common ground and continued our research. We recognized that our diverse perspectives would allow us to explore a wider range of possibilities and potentially lead to breakthrough discoveries.

(correction)Light. Light enables us, the human, to have a macro universe. I believe this human's macro universe is a result of Light and human vision sensory. And we also have another sensory called consciousness. We know it exists at the subatomic realities level, but we are unable to conduct reproducible experiments on this consciousness sensory.

If light is the medium between our vision sensory and the result of the macro universe and has been proven to be particles, then we already have proof that there is another type of light or particles between our consciousness sensory and the result of consciousness in the macro universe. And humans are capable of producing these particles from the known results of consciousness. For instance, when a person suddenly notices something has happened to their close relative in very far distances without any macro universe information about their close relative, it means one of these two entities must generate some kind of particles that allow the other side of the entity to have the result of consciousness â€“ 'something happened to their close relative,' which in general is 'information'.

### Stay tuned

Our collaboration in cosmic linguistics is ongoing. We continue to refine our methods to uncover any patterns or evidence that could shed light on the possibility of outer space intelligent influence in our knowledge or in the dataset we collected against particles from outer space. Stay tuned for updates on our journey!
