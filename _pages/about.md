ActiVating.AI was born out of an exciting adventure in the realm of machine learning competitions on Kaggle - a platform that fosters data science enthusiasts to showcase their prowess in solving complex problems through cutting-edge algorithms and models. One such competition, "IceCube - Neutrinos in Deep Ice," caught our attention as it involved predicting values from a dataset containing information about elusive subatomic particles known as neutrinos. Delving into the challenge([Github link](https://github.com/activating-ai/IceCube-Neutrinos-in-Deep-Ice), [Kaggle notebook link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tyeestudio/language-from-outer-space-in-icecube-data)) we realized that these minute particles, originating from the depths of outer space, seemed to harbor a hidden linguistic structure. This revelation led us to wonder if language models like GPT/Transformers could be utilized for SETI's (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) alien research. Then

Intrigued and inspired by this potential, our team began developing a local chat-based AI Research and Learning LAB. The efforts yielded results when we observed how this chat-based AI laboratory aided in generating ideas and conducting studies on various SETI-related subjects. This success sparked an idea - if such Research and Learning LAB could be beneficial for our research, why not make them accessible to other scientists, engineers, and citizen scientists alike? And thus, the journey towards creating Freewill.AGENT(s) began. We wanted to democratize this advanced technology, enabling a wide array of individuals to tap into the power of AI-driven analysis and exploration. This is the tale of how our product was conceived and crafted, fueled by curiosity, innovation, and the boundless potential of language models.ur product was conceived and crafted, fueled by curiosity, innovation, and the boundless potential of language models.
