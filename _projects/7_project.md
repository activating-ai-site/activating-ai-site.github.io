Introducing the freewill.QUEST(beta) Research and Learning LAB - Your Personal AI Adventure

Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

With our unique game-like text quests, you'll be immersed in an interactive world where research and learning feels like an adventure instead of a chore. The freewill.QUEST LAB offers a fun and engaging way to explore new ideas, concepts, and theories without relying on external resources like the cloud or external communication channels. This means your ideas and discoveries remain private, allowing for a more focused and private environment to foster creativity and innovation.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

    Agent guidance
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The freewill.QUEST Research and Learning LAB is the companion for anyone looking to dive headfirst into the exciting world of AI and push the boundaries of knowledge. Engage in a conversation with this artificial intelligence agent with the aim to gather sufficient information prior to seeking advice from your team members or other external sources - let the AI agent be your guide as you chart new territory in your projects and research endeavors. Make this powerful tool your first port of call, and unleash your full potential.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
